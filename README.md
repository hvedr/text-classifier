# Text Classifier

This repo is not kind of a clear Text Classifier repo, but includes both:
* Authors and text groups classifier based on statistical symbol distributions
* Texts Hurst exponent values calculator

Unfortunately, text classifier wasn't a main aim of this project, but might be finished for working with different texts and languages (currently it's russian only :( )

The main study about Hurst exponent values in texts is in progress and might be presented in another paper, but it is also partitially considered [here: arXiv:1611.09122](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09122) ([Publised in Preprints of the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics, June 2016 (rus)](http://keldysh.ru/papers/2016/prep2016_52.pdf))

The most appropriate result can be already seen [here](https://github.com/sergeyshilin/text-classifier/blob/master/notebooks/Languages%20distribution%20plots.ipynb)

For this part I also use [WikiExtractor](https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor) and [utils](https://github.com/sergeyshilin/text-classifier/tree/master/utils) to work with it more easily.
